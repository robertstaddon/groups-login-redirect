# groups-login-redirect

This plugin adds redirect functionality to the [Groups](https://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/) plugin by itthinx. An administrator
can specify which WordPress page that a user will be redirected to after logging in based on the Group to which they are a member.
There is also a priority setting for situations in which a single member is part of multiple Groups.
